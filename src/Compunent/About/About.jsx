       <strong className="text-yellow-500"> Luigi Mangione,</strong> a 26-year-old Maryland native, was charged with
        murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan. A former
        valedictorian and engineer, he struggled with health issues and was
        arrested on December 9, 2024, carrying a manifesto criticizing the
        healthcare system. His case has sparked public debate but also warnings
        against glorifying violence.
